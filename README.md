# class-survey

This is the git project for a class survey tool, which teachers can use to let students type in their information in the beginning of a semester or school year for a later look up of important stuff like picture, name, advisor, class and other custom fields.

The frontend will be written in Angular 2 and will be ported to mobile platforms. The backend will be either PHP or Node.js
